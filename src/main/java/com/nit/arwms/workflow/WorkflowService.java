/**
 * Service layer for Workflow business logic.
 * 
 * This class handles all workflow-related business operations,
 * keeping the controller focused on HTTP concerns only.
 * 
 * Key Concept: @Service Annotation
 * --------------------------------
 * - Marks this class as a Spring-managed service component
 * - Spring automatically creates a single instance (singleton by default)
 * - Can be injected into other components (like controllers)
 * - Semantically indicates "this is where business logic lives"
